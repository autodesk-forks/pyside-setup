Qt For Python is the [Python Qt bindings project](http://wiki.qt.io/PySide2), providing access to the complete Qt 5.x framework as well as to generator tools for rapidly generating bindings for any C++ libraries.

Shiboken2 is the generator used to build the bindings.

See README.pyside2.md and README.shiboken2.md for details.
